Welcome to this Advent Sunday. Let us enter into the Joyful Mysteries with hearts open to hope and expectation.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Today we contemplate the Joyful Mysteries in the light of Advent: the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the Presentation in the Temple, and the Finding in the Temple. These moments reveal God’s nearness, Mary’s trust, and the quiet unfolding of salvation.
Queen of the Holy Rosary, you who awaited the coming of the Savior with faith and love, inspire my heart with a spirit of joyful expectation. As I meditate on these mysteries of Redemption, grant me the grace I ask in this Rosary (mention your request), and help me prepare a place for Christ in my life and in the world. I ask this for the greater glory of God, for your honor, and for the good of souls — especially my own. Amen.
I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

O my Jesus, forgive our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead all souls to heaven, especially those most in need of Your mercy. Amen.
The First Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation. Fruit of the Mystery: Humility.
I desire a deep and abiding love for humility. Let us reflect on the moment when the Angel Gabriel announced to the Blessed Virgin Mary that she was chosen to be the Mother of God. With pure humility and trust, Mary said, Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Second Joyful Mystery: The Visitation. Fruit of the Mystery: Charity toward Neighbor.
I desire a heart filled with charity toward my neighbor. Let us reflect on how the Blessed Virgin Mary, carrying Jesus in her womb, visited her cousin Elizabeth. Moved by love, she stayed for three months, offering comfort and support as Elizabeth prepared for the birth of John the Baptist.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Third Joyful Mystery: The Nativity. Fruit of the Mystery: Love of God.
I desire a heart overflowing with love for God. Let us reflect on the humble birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. In a simple stable, the Blessed Virgin Mary laid our God and Redeemer in a manger. Surrounded by poverty, divine love was born for the salvation of the world.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Fourth Joyful Mystery: The Presentation in the Temple. Fruit of the Mystery: Spirit of Sacrifice.
I desire a generous spirit of sacrifice, offered with love and obedience. Let us reflect on how Mary and Joseph brought the infant Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord. Simeon and Anna rejoiced in the Messiah’s arrival. We honor Mary’s surrender and Jesus’ first offering to the Father.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Fifth Joyful Mystery: The Finding of Jesus in the Temple. Fruit of the Mystery: Zeal for the Glory of God.
I desire an ever-growing zeal for the glory of God. Let us reflect on the sorrow of Mary and Joseph as they searched for the child Jesus, who remained in Jerusalem. After three days, they found Him in the temple among the teachers, listening and asking questions. We seek to stay close to Christ and fulfill the Father’s will.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
Let us pray: O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his life, Death, and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech thee, that while meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
To you, O blessed Joseph, do we come in our tribulation, and having implored the help of your most holy Spouse, we confidently invoke your patronage also.  Through that charity which bound you to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God and through the paternal love with which you embraced the Child Jesus, we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance which Jesus Christ has purchased by his Blood, and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities.  O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family, defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ; O most loving father, ward off from us every contagion of error and corrupting influence; O our most mighty protector, be kind to us and from heaven assist us in our struggle with the power of darkness.  As once you rescued the Child Jesus from deadly peril, so now protect God's Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity; shield, too, each one of us by your constant protection, so that, supported by your example and your aid, we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness, and to obtain eternal happiness in heaven.  Amen.
Mary, Mother of Hope, thank you for walking with us through these Joyful Mysteries of Advent. As we await the coming of Christ, may your example of trust and surrender guide our hearts.
We entrust to you all our intentions, spoken and silent, and we ask your intercession for peace in our homes, healing in our communities, and readiness in our hearts to welcome the Lord.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
