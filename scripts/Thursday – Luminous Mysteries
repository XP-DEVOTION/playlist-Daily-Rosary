Welcome to Thursday’s Rosary. May the light of Christ guide our hearts and minds today.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Today we contemplate the Luminous Mysteries: the Baptism in the Jordan, the Wedding at Cana, the Proclamation of the Kingdom, the Transfiguration, and the Institution of the Eucharist. These mysteries reveal the glory of Christ’s mission and the light He brings to the world.
Queen of the Holy Rosary, you who witnessed the unfolding of your Son’s public ministry, inspire my heart with a deeper love for His teachings and sacraments. May this Rosary draw me closer to the truth, and grant the grace I ask (mention your request), for the glory of God, your honor, and the good of souls, especially my own. Amen.
I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

O my Jesus, forgive our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead all souls to heaven, especially those most in need of Your mercy. Amen.
The First Luminous Mystery: The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan. Fruit of the Mystery: Openness to the Holy Spirit. I desire to open my heart to the Holy Spirit. Let us reflect on Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan by John the Baptist. As He rose from the water, the heavens opened, the Spirit descended like a dove, and the Father’s voice said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Second Luminous Mystery: The Wedding at Cana. Fruit of the Mystery: Trust in Mary’s Intercession. I desire to trust in Mary’s intercession. Let us reflect on Christ’s first miracle at the wedding in Cana, where, at Mary’s request, He turned water into wine. Through her words, Do whatever He tells you, she guides us to faith in her Son.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Third Luminous Mystery: The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God. Fruit of the Mystery: Conversion of Heart. I desire a heart transformed by God’s grace. Let us reflect on Jesus proclaiming the Kingdom of God, calling all to repentance and faith. Through His words and mercy, He invites us to conversion, especially through the sacrament of reconciliation.

The Fourth Luminous Mystery: The Transfiguration of Jesus. Fruit of the Mystery: Desire for Holiness. I desire to grow in holiness through God’s grace. Let us reflect on Jesus’ transfiguration on Mount Tabor, where His face shone like the sun and His clothes became dazzling white. The Father’s voice said, This is my beloved Son; listen to Him.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

The Fifth Luminous Mystery: The Institution of the Eucharist. Fruit of the Mystery: Active Participation at Mass. I desire to participate fully in the Holy Mass. Let us reflect on Jesus at the Last Supper, when He offered bread and wine as His Body and Blood. In this act of love, He gave Himself as food for our souls and sealed the New Covenant.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to you we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
Let us pray: O God, whose Only Begotten Son, by his life, Death, and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech thee, that while meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
To you, O blessed Joseph, do we come in our tribulation, and having implored the help of your most holy Spouse, we confidently invoke your patronage also.  Through that charity which bound you to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God and through the paternal love with which you embraced the Child Jesus, we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance which Jesus Christ has purchased by his Blood, and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities.  O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family, defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ; O most loving father, ward off from us every contagion of error and corrupting influence; O our most mighty protector, be kind to us and from heaven assist us in our struggle with the power of darkness.  As once you rescued the Child Jesus from deadly peril, so now protect God's Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity; shield, too, each one of us by your constant protection, so that, supported by your example and your aid, we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness, and to obtain eternal happiness in heaven.  Amen.
Mother of Light, we thank you for your presence in this prayer. Through the Luminous Mysteries, we have walked with Christ in moments of revelation and received the light of His truth and love.
May these mysteries strengthen our faith, renew our desire to follow Him, and inspire us to be bearers of His light in the world.
We entrust to you all who seek clarity, healing, and purpose, and we ask your intercession for wisdom, peace, and grace.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
