Join us this Friday for a solemn meditation on the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary, reflecting on Christ’s passion and His profound love for humanity:

1) The Agony in the Garden
2) The Scourging at the Pillar
3) The Crowning with Thorns
4) The Carrying of the Cross
5) The Crucifixion

These mysteries draw us into the depths of Christ’s suffering, inviting us to unite our own trials with His mercy and sacrifice.
