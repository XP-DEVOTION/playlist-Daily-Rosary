Join us this Sunday in Lent for a solemn meditation on the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary, entering into Christ’s passion and the depth of His mercy:

1) The Agony in the Garden
2) The Scourging at the Pillar
3) The Crowning with Thorns
4) The Carrying of the Cross
5) The Crucifixion

These mysteries invite us to walk with Christ through suffering, to reflect on the cost of redemption, and to open our hearts to His healing grace.
