Join us this Sunday in Advent for a peaceful meditation on the Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary, reflecting on the promise of Christ’s coming and Mary’s faithful joy:

1) The Annunciation
2) The Visitation
3) The Nativity
4) The Presentation
5) The Finding in the Temple

These mysteries shine with anticipation, humility, and divine love — perfect for the Advent season as we prepare our hearts for the birth of Christ.
