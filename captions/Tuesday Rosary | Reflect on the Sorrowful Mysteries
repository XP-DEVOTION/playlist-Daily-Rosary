Join us this Tuesday for a heartfelt meditation on the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary, entering into Christ’s passion and the depth of His love:

1) The Agony in the Garden
2) The Scourging at the Pillar
3) The Crowning with Thorns
4) The Carrying of the Cross
5) The Crucifixion

These mysteries invite us to contemplate Christ’s suffering, the cost of redemption, and the mercy offered to all.
