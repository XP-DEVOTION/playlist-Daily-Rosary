Join us this Thursday for a contemplative meditation on the Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary, revealing Christ’s public ministry and the light He brings to the world:

1) The Baptism in the Jordan
2) The Wedding at Cana
3) The Proclamation of the Kingdom
4) The Transfiguration
5) The Institution of the Eucharist

These mysteries illuminate Christ’s divinity, His call to conversion, and the gift of the Eucharist — inviting us to walk in His light.
